Not too sure the format for this and what belongs here.

I created this program to handle via perl the increasingly large number of
SSHFS-mounted filesystems I was using. This program keeps track of the filesystems,
both remotely and local mountpoints, but not passwords.

Configuration is held in ~/.mount.conf, which looks like this :

### .mount.conf
# like many config files, hashes comment out

Machine1    |M|sshfs|machine1.long.url:   | /home/me/Machine1
Machine2    | |sshfs|machine2.long.url:   | /home/me/Machine2
#            ^ M indicates mounting via mount-all setting
Machine2Log |M|sshfs|machine2.long.url:/var/log | /home/me/Machine2log



The fields are:
    Name - the name of this mountpoint, for individual mounting and unmounting
    M    - indicates whether this gets mounted on mount-all
    Protocol - right now, only sshfs is supported
    Remote - follows the SSHFS syntax for remote mounts:
            network_address:/remote/file/system/if/any
    Local - where the mount point is on the local file system
